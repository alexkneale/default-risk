                <h2>Looking at your answers</h2>
                In the form you just filled out, you answered a number of
                questions, and based on your responses, our algorithm decided
                that you were at risk of defaulting on a potential mortgage.
                From analysing our data and algorithm, we've found that
                <strong>Credit Score</strong>,
                <strong>Requested Mortgage Size</strong> and
                <strong>Debt to Income ratio</strong> (monthly debt payments
                divided by monthly income) are the most important factors for
                determining default risk. Below, we have shown you how your
                responses to these three factors compared with the those in our
                dataset. This may give you some indication as to why your
                mortgage request was rejected.

                <h2>Our Algorithm</h2>

                <div class="algorithm__writing--1">
                    You may be wondering "How common is defaulting on a
                    mortgage?". Not common at all. In fact, only 2.2% of all
                    mortgages ever default (see pie chart). That said,
                    defaulting is very expensive for banks when it DOES happen.
                    So best avoided.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The goal of our algorithm is to determine what distinguishes
                    the 2.2% of defaulting mortgages from the rest. The problem
                    is, from our data, there may not be a whole lot separating
                    someone who defaulted, from someone else who didn't. In
                    other words, constructing an algorithm that can detect ALL
                    people who are risk of defaulting, is a close-to-impossible
                    task. A more realistic goal is to try to detect SOME of
                    these risky mortgage requests, so that the bank will have a
                    tool to avoid these risky investments.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The problem with designing such an algorithm, is that you
                    will always have to deal with
                    <strong>misclassifications</strong>: default cases that are
                    accidentally classified as non-risky, and (even more
                    unfairly) perfectly safe mortgages that are misclassified as
                    at risk of defaulting.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </div>

                <div class="pie pie__default--container">
                    <h4>How common is defaulting?</h4>
                    <canvas
                        id="pieDefault"

                        max-width="500px"

                </div>

                <div class="algorithm__writing--1">
                    In our algorithm, we opted for a more conservative
                    algorithm, which doesn't take many risks. In other words, it
                    correctly detects 68% of all mortgages at risk of
                    defaulting, but at the cost of misclassifying a lot of
                    perfectly good mortgages as at-risk of defaulting.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    All of this is more easily explained looking at our pie
                    chart here. We said earlier that, that 2.2% of all mortgages
                    default, meaning that 97.8% of mortgages are perfectly safe
                    investments for our bank. In our algorith, we correctly
                    classify about a two thirds of risky defaults (1.5% of total
                    population of mortgages). This means that roughly a third of
                    risky mortgages (0.7% of all mortgages) effectively slip
                    through our algorithm test. Nevertheless, our algorithm, on
                    the whole, is good news for the bank, as we avoid giving
                    away fair number of risky mortgages, which would lose the
                    bank money.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Here comes the flip side to our algorithm. Yes, we save
                    money by avoiding 68% of all risky mortgages, but at a cost:
                    misclassifying a significant number of perfectly safe
                    mortgages as at-risk of defaulting. More exactly 25% of ALL
                    mortgages. Therefore, even though we're saving money by
                    avoiding some risky mortgages, we're also losing money by
                    not doing business with many perfectly safe mortgages. In
                    fact, if a mortgage request is flagged as risky by our
                    algorithm, there is only a 5.7% chance that it would
                    default. You can see the trade-off here.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    At our bank, and in many others, we have done the math, and
                    found that we are still saving money overall by using this
                    algorithm. This is good news for us, but less good news for
                    you, as consumers. Below, we want to give you the
                    opportunity to fill out the form as many times as you want,
                    so you can effectively play around with the algorithm, and
                    understand its inner workings.
