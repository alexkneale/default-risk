                            First of all, Bank of Tomorrow is NOT a real bank.
                            Rather, this website was set up to make people aware
                            of the algorithms underlying banking decisions, like
                            whether a bank will give you a mortgage or not.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            AI has been affecting many industries, including
                            banking. Here, we have created a fairly simple
                            Machine Learning (ML) algorithm which will decide
                            whether an individual is entitled to a mortgage. The
                            idea of this project is to let people interact
                            freely with the algorithm, to better understand how
                            such algorithms work, and essentially why banks may
                            be rejecting their mortgage applications. For more
                            information on our algorithm, please read the next
                            <a href="#algorithm"> section </a>

            <section id="algorithm" class="algorithm">

                <div class="algorithm__content">
                    <div class="algorithm__container">

                        <p class="algorithm__content--paragraph">
                            The fundamental goal of our algorithm is to detect
                            individuals who are at risk of defaulting on their
                            mortgage. Mortgage defaulting is bad news for any
                            bank, as it involves an often lengthy and expensive
                            legal process, where overall money is lost.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            When a bank agrees to give you a mortgage, they are
                            in effect taking some sort of risk. To minimize
                            costs, banks will only want to give mortgages to
                            people who are less likely to default on their
                            mortgage, and so are less 'risky'. In this
                            algorithm, we have worked with a 2017-2018 dataset
                            provided by
                            <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/"
                                >Freddie Mac</a
                            >
                            in the US. It is one of the few publicly available
                            datasets about mortgage default. We have used this
                            dataset to create an ML algorith, which can detect
                            whether an individual is likely to default on their
                            mortgage or not. <br />
                            <br />

                            You may (reasonably) ask the question: "How relevant
                            is an algorithm that was created from a 2017-2018 US
                            study, if I want to try to get a mortgage in the UK
                            in 2025?". Every ML model has its limitations, and
                            ours is no exception. In fact, our algorithm was not
                            designed to give you a whole lot of actionable
                            insight. Our idea was to empower consumers, by
                            letting them interact with an ML algorithm that is
                            similar to those used by real banks. This way,
                            consumers can gain insights into how ML banking
                            models work under the hood, and understand the
                            hidden biases in these algorithms. If this interests
